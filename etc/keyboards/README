# KEYBOARD LAYOUT
#
# Each key is defined as xy where x is
# the lower case and y is the upper case
# character for that key. Letters are assumed
# to have their upper case character on the
# same key so a is the same as aA.
#
# Meta-keys like tab/shift/ctrl/space are not
# specified - their location is not
# subject to optimization
#
# Finger assignment for each key is based on 0..9 finger
# index
#
#  01234  56789         :  = pinky 
#  :|||/  \|||:         |  = middle fingers
#  left   right        / \ = thumbs
#  hand   hand
#
# Finger assignment follows the touch-typing convention. Thumbs
# are restricted to the space bar which is not subject to layout
# optimization and therefore thumb indexes (4,5) do not appear
# in the blocks' fingers parameter
# 
# Row 1 finger assignment for keys such as 1, 9 and - tends
# to vary between individuals.
#
# NOTE: rows are 1-indexed
