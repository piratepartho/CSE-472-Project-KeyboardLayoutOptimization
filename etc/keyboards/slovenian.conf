# Slovenian candidate from 
# Rolando Benjamin Vaz Ferreira
#
# diacriticals:
# c -> *
# s -> @
# z -> &
#
# Take care to define upper case of diacritical remappings
# different from lowercase (e.g. &! but not &&). A bug results
# in incorrect effort calculation during optimization when lower and
# upper case are the same.
#
# Slovenian lacks 'q'
