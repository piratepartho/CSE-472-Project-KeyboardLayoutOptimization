# CSE-472-Project-KeyboardLayoutOptimization

This repo contains our work done for CSE 472 Machine Learning Course Project.

We try to optimize Touch Typed Bangla Keyboard Layouts using [carpalx](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/) model. Most of the code has been taken from this [this repo](https://github.com/kerenivasch/MKLOGA/tree/main)

Please refer to [Report.pdf](https://github.com/piratepartho/CSE-472-Project-KeyboardLayoutOptimization/blob/main/Report.pdf) for further details about this project.
